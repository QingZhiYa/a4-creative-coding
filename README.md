This is a 2D Audio Visualizer made with Canvas.js. 
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- Goal: The goal is to make a 2D audio visualizer that the users could modify display.
- Challenges: The web does not allow audio to auto-play, so I have to add actions before the song plays.
